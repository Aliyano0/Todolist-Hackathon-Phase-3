## Prompt

Create a Prompt History Record for the feature specification work in the general category

## Response snapshot

I've created a Prompt History Record for the feature specification work in the general category. The PHR includes all required metadata fields filled appropriately, and documents the user's request to create a PHR for general feature specification work. The record is stored in the correct location under history/prompts/general/ with the appropriate naming convention.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created PHR documenting the feature specification work process
- 🧪 Tests: No tests needed for this PHR creation task
- 📁 Files: Created 1 PHR file at history/prompts/general/001-feature-specification.general.prompt.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Could include more specific feature specifications
- 🧠 Reflection: PHR properly captures the intent to create PHRs for general feature work

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Not applicable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Create more specific PHRs for individual features
