Generated research.md documenting decisions on directory consolidation, Next.js 16+ App Router implementation, file migration strategy, theme management, API integration, responsive design, and animation implementation. Created data-model.md outlining frontend entities (Todo Item, User Profile, Theme Settings, Application Layout). Developed quickstart.md with setup instructions and project structure overview. Generated API contract for Todo operations with OpenAPI specification. All constitution checks passed for documentation-first approach, clean architecture, tech stack compliance, TDD workflow, authentication requirements, and CLAUDE.md file existence."
